# Paddle Pong

A simple, modular Pong clone written in Rust using the [ggez](https://ggez.rs/) game framework.  
The ball is rendered as a rotating circle, it bounces off all walls and your paddle, and you earn points for each successful hit. You start with 3 lives, and the game ends when you run out.
